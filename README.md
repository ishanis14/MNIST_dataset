# MNIST_dataset
A very simple beginner level project involving the concepts of Deep Learning and Computer Vision

What did I do in this project ?
I studied on how I can create a neural network which could classify numerical digits from a dataset. 

MNIST DATASET: The MNIST dataset is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. It contains 70,000 images of handwritten numbers. 

Neural Networks are basically algorithms inspired by the brain. So an artificial neural network is made up of 3 layers :
1. Input Layer 
2. Hidden Lyer 
3. Output Layer 

Deep Learning comes into play when it is used to extract useful pieces of information or make decisions using Neural Networks. 

The major steps which have been carried out are: 
1. importing the modules we require
2. loading the dataset 
3. plotting the dataset 
4. creating a neural netwrok model 
5. training the model which we have created 
6. finally testing the model which we have created! 
7. analyzing the accuracy and the loss 

With respect to this project and the code I have written, we first start by importing all the useful modules.
what are Modules?
Modules are files which contain functions which can be used. 

Then after importing we can use either Keras or Tensorflow to build our neural network. 
Tensorflow is a free,open source and more detailed library used to develop neural networks, it is a bit tough to code so I have used Keras (which is a more easier to use tool and is built upon TensorFlow) for learning purposes. Apart from developing neural networks, Keras also has the ability to download Datasets like MNIST. 

After downloading the dataset we will divide the data in to 2 sets, onw will be the training dataset and the other one will be the testing dataset. Generally 80% of data is used for training and 20% for testing.
